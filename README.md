Flutter SDK:3.16.0

Notes:
implemented 3 screen basic ui with validations(without image)

Validations:
Email: As per the standard emailid
Name: Minimum one characater not allowing space
Password:Minium one character

State Management:Getx

Suggesions(what we can do)
- create a common image file like appconstants
- common button and textstyle for application
- can create custom widget for avoid multiple time same code
- can use routes for navigation
- can add screen utils

- We can add above point,but due to time limit,i don't added,we can implemet this point one time whenever we septup poject, so its only one time time taking process.

- let me know if you have any query.
